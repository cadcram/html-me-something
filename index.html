                        "[East Asia] is a sleeping giant. Let her sleep, 
                        for when she wakes she will move the world." After I graduated college
                        and I considered how I would make an impact on this world, this quote from
                        Napoleon Bonaparte resonanted in my mind. I heard this quote years prior as 
                        a student when I spent a summer in East Asia serving with a campus ministry
                        that I was a part of called Cru. My experience that Summer was deeply impactful to my 
                        my faith and my growth as a person. As a result, I decided that I would spend a year 
                        working with this campus ministry in East Asia.

                                with for the next year. With the exception of a few people, I had never met these people, but within 
                                a couple days they became good friends, whom I still keep in contact.

                                A significant portion of my time in East Asia was working with Cru on college campuses.
                                For those unfamiliar with campus ministries, my responsiblities included meeting students, 
                                building relationships, bringing up spirtual conversation, and facilitating community. As someone 
                                who worked with Cru in the States and in East Asia, the East Asia culture requires a majority of time 
                                spent in building relationships. The photo above is of a group hangout time that several coworkers and me
                                set up to continue to build relationship with our East Asian friends. I became very good friends with some 
                                of these students despite cultural differenece and miss them very much.

                                East Asia holds thousands of years of rich history. Sites as pictured above are over 600 years, which is about three
                                time as old as the United States. I enjoyed going to these sites and learning about history and about the culture that
                                hosted me over course of the year. Although this joy soon became over shadowed by the idiosyncrasies of the East Asia people.
                                These historical sites not only attract international vistors, but many East Asians who have never seen a foreigner. As a result, every 
                                East Asian from the boonies wants to take a picture with you. Trust me, it becomes much less flattering after the fifth time.

                         The biggest holiday in East Asia is Lunar New Year. Many people go home during this time of year to visit family and celebrate. As a result, the city I was in was 
                        very empty and many businesses shut down, including grocery stores. In order to stay alive, my team and I were able to travel to Thailand. This is <b>THE</b>
                        beach destination in all of Asia. It was much needed solace because where I lived in East Asia was very cold and very poluted. The sunshine and clear blue skies
                        can rejuvenate the mind and the body.

                        Many people travel the world for the sites and experiences, but the year I spent in East Asia made me realize that what give most expereinces their meaning is 
                        the relationships that you form on the way. A photo below shows my roommates and I on a trip that we took to Hong Kong. This is only weeks before we went home and 
                        parted ways, so we spent it exploring an exciting place together! Below that photo, is my last Sunday at the church I attended, which served as an important community of 
                        faith that guided me through this year full of new stresses and confusion and pointed me to God, who is our peace.

                        There is many more things to say about this year I spent in East Asia. The sights, the smells, which are many in this country, but most importantly the people
                        met along the way would take ages to explain, but I hope this gave you a quick snapshot of my expereince. Thanks for reading!
